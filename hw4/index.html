						<b><u>About This Website:</u></b>
						<br/>
						<p>This webpage is basically my first ever AWS-curated webpage designed for me to learn HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Web Design in general. Forgive the very amateurish feel of this website, as I am still <em>very new</em> to the front-end process of web development. Anyhow, feel free to browse through the different pages above, and have fun navigating through my website! Hopefully it'll look better as I get better and feel better to navigate as I feel better about coding in HTML.</p>

							About:
							<dd>This is the About page, the page where my backstory is explained! <em>WOW!</em> Learn all about me in this super brief and well-paced page full of information about myself, my past, and any hopes and dreams I have that are probably gonna change within a year but still!</dd>

							Contact:
							<dd>This is just a page with my contact information: cellphone, email(s), etc.</dd>
