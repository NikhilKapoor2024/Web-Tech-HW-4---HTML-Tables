# Web-Tech-HW-4---HTML-Tables
Fourth assignment for Web Technologies

This was the fourth assignment I did for my Web Technologies class, which required us to create four HTML pages that users can navigate through. I had to design each page using tables, had to title all the different pages, and create links that connect to the HTML pages and make them all functional. I skipped assignments 2 and because the way assignments are structured in this Web Tech class is that they all build on each other, so this better represents what I've learned.
